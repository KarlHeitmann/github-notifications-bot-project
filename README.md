# Installation instructions.

## virtualenv

> python -m venv venv

This instruction will work on POSIX system. ie, in Windows probably won't work

> source venv/bin/activate

This may be different on windows, take a look here https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
Search for "activate" in your browser, and take a look at the table with headers:

Platform | Shell | Command to activate virtual environment

If you are using Windows, take a look at the row that reads "Windows", there 

To read the dependencies and start using the project, run this command:

> pip install -r requirements.txt
